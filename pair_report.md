<!-- why are we doing this? -->

## Introduction
<!-- Succinctly describe the project  -->
### Aims
<!-- discussing what you expect to learn from the assignment in general (and for
each task) -->
The aim of this project is to gain an understanding of how computer networks can
verify document authenticy through the development of a simple application. While
developing this application we will also learn how certificates and signatures
work and apply this information in a practical setting. As the project is to be
carries out in pairs we also aim to become more effective in collaboration and
working as part of a team, a skill that will be crucial post university.
### Objectives
<!-- Things needed to achieve aims -->

<!-- what is our solution? -->
### Requirments
<!-- What functions do we need the program to do? -->

## Application
<!-- what your pair did and what you produced -->
<!-- how does the application achieve the project goal  -->
### Usage
<!-- how does our solution work? -->

## Design
### Environment
<!-- describe the environment that you used to complete the tasks (e.g., what ma-
chines, software and versions) -->
### Certificates
<!-- List certificates -->
<!-- cut-and-paste the command line with the responses, documenting the steps
taken on each of the tasks above -->
<!-- Justify how the certs were created and used -->
### Code Structure
<!-- List source files and code along with a brief account of how it works -->

## Afterthoughts
### Challenges
<!-- document any difficulties that you
met while doing any of the tasks -->
### Observations
<!-- Explain any observations that are interesting or surprising -->
### Reflection
<!-- what would we do differently?
what are the problems with the project? -->
